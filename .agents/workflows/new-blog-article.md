description: How to create a new blog article with gold-standard SEO, LLM schema markup, and information gain
---

# Blog Article Creation Standard

Follow this guide when adding new articles to the AI Velocity blog. All articles are stored in `src/lib/insightsData.js` and rendered via the `src/app/news-insights/[slug]/page.jsx` template, which auto-generates all JSON-LD schema markup.

---

## 1. Data Structure

Every article in the `insightsData` array must include these fields:

```javascript
{
    id: "4",
    slug: "your-article-slug",
    title: "Your Article Title",
    category: "Agentic Commerce",
    date: "2026-04-01T08:00:00Z",
    author: "AI Velocity Engineering",
    readTime: "8 min read",
    image: "/images/insights/your-slug.webp",
    excerpt: "...",
    content: `...`,
    faqs: [{ question: "...", answer: "..." }]
}
```

### Image Requirements — MANDATORY Local WebP Workflow

All blog images **MUST** be stored locally as optimised WebP files. Do NOT reference external URLs (e.g. Unsplash CDN) in production articles.

**Step-by-step procedure for every new article:**

1. **Source a high-resolution image** from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com) (or another royalty-free source). Minimum 1200px wide.
2. **Check for duplicates** — verify no existing article in `insightsData` uses the same image. Every article must have a unique hero image.
3. **Download and convert to WebP** using this command from the project root:
   ```bash
   # Install sharp if not already available
   npm install sharp --no-save

   # Download and convert (replace SLUG and URL)
   node -e "
   const sharp = require('sharp');
   const https = require('https');
   const fs = require('fs');
   const url = 'UNSPLASH_URL_HERE?q=80&w=1200&auto=format&fit=crop';
   const out = 'public/images/insights/ARTICLE-SLUG.webp';
   https.get(url, r => { if(r.statusCode >= 300 && r.headers.location) { https.get(r.headers.location, r2 => { const c=[]; r2.on('data',d=>c.push(d)); r2.on('end',()=>sharp(Buffer.concat(c)).resize(1200,null,{withoutEnlargement:true}).webp({quality:80}).toFile(out).then(()=>console.log('Done:',out))); }); } else { const c=[]; r.on('data',d=>c.push(d)); r.on('end',()=>sharp(Buffer.concat(c)).resize(1200,null,{withoutEnlargement:true}).webp({quality:80}).toFile(out).then(()=>console.log('Done:',out))); } });
   "
   ```
4. **Set the `image` field** in `insightsData.js` to the local path: `/images/insights/your-slug.webp`
5. **Verify the image loads** in the browser on both the listing page and the article detail page.

> **Why local WebP?** Eliminates external DNS lookups, prevents broken images if the source CDN changes, keeps visitor data private (GDPR-friendly), gives full cache control, and ensures images are indexed under your domain for image search SEO. WebP files are 60-80% smaller than equivalent JPEGs.

### Auto-Generated Schema & Metadata (No Manual Work)

The `[slug]/page.jsx` template automatically generates:

- **Article/NewsArticle JSON-LD** — 15+ fields including `image` (absolute URL), `wordCount`, `dateModified`, `articleSection`, `mainEntityOfPage`, `speakable`, `inLanguage`, `isAccessibleForFree`
- **FAQPage JSON-LD** — Separate schema block, auto-generated from the `faqs` array
- **OpenGraph meta tags** — `og:title`, `og:description`, `og:type`, `og:url`, `og:image` (with width/height/alt), `og:publishedTime`, `og:modifiedTime`, `og:tags`
- **Twitter Card meta tags** — `twitter:card` (summary_large_image), `twitter:title`, `twitter:description`, `twitter:image`
- **Canonical URL** — Prevents duplicate content issues
- **Sitemap entry** — `src/app/sitemap.js` auto-includes all articles from `insightsData`

---

## 2. Word Count Targets

| Category | Type | Target Words | Read Time |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Insight** | Pillar/Thought Leadership | 1,500–2,500 | 6–10 min |
| **News** | Deployment/Update/Announcement | 600–800 | 3–4 min |

Articles shorter than these targets lack the depth needed for SEO authority and LLM citation weight.

---

## 3. Content Structure (Markdown)

Use this heading hierarchy inside the `content` template literal:

```markdown
## Main Section Heading (H2)

Introductory paragraph for this section.

### Subsection Heading (H3)

Supporting detail paragraph.

**Bold Key Term**

Explanation of the key term.
```

**Rules:**
- Use `##` (H2) for main section breaks, these become anchor points
- Use `###` (H3) for subsections within a main section
- Never use `#` (H1), the article `title` is the H1
- Use `**bold**` for key terms and emphasis
- Use bullet lists (`*`) for feature lists or specifications
- Keep paragraphs to 3-5 sentences maximum
- **NEVER use em dashes (—)** in any content. Use commas, semicolons, colons, or full stops instead:
  - ❌ `This is important — it drives revenue`
  - ✅ `This is important. It drives revenue`
  - ✅ `This is important, as it drives revenue`
  - ✅ `This is important; it drives revenue`

### Allowed Categories
- `Agentic Commerce`
- `Agentic Marketing`
- `Agentic Payments`
- `Agentic AEO`
- `News`

### URL Convention for Categories

Each category has a dedicated, SEO-indexed page at `/news-insights/{category-slug}`. The category slug registry lives in `src/lib/categoryRegistry.js`.

**Rules:**
- Category slugs are **always lowercase kebab-case** (e.g., `agentic-commerce`, not `Agentic Commerce`)
- Category slugs must **NEVER** match an existing article slug (article slugs are long descriptive titles, so this should never happen naturally)
- Adding a new category requires **two changes**: (1) add an entry in `CATEGORY_SLUGS` and `CATEGORY_META` in `src/lib/categoryRegistry.js`, (2) add the display name to the `getCategories()` array in `src/app/news-insights/page.jsx`
- The sitemap (`src/app/sitemap.js`) auto-generates entries from `CATEGORY_SLUGS`
- URL format: `/news-insights/{category-slug}` (no `/category/` prefix)

### Content Styles

Every Insight article should use one of the two approved content styles. Choose the style that best fits the subject matter. News articles follow standard announcement formatting and do not use either style.

**Style A: Thought Leadership Insight**
- Written from a first-person expertise perspective ("we recommend", "we have observed", "the approach we advocate")
- Positions AI Velocity as a knowledgeable guide helping readers understand a topic
- Can reference industry data, observations, and general experience
- Example framing: "Why Every Enterprise Needs an Agentic Readiness Framework"
- Tone: authoritative, advisory, educational

**Style B: Industry Analysis**
- Written from a third-person market perspective ("the industry is moving toward", "organisations are adopting", "emerging patterns suggest")
- Discusses trends, technologies, and shifts as industry phenomena
- Can reference aggregated data and general market observations
- Example framing: "Machine-to-Machine Negotiation Protocols Are Reshaping Autonomous Commerce"
- Tone: analytical, objective, forward-looking

### Content Authenticity Rules

These rules are non-negotiable and apply to all article styles:

1. **Never claim AI Velocity has built, deployed, launched, or shipped products, platforms, protocols, or services** unless they genuinely exist and are live
2. **Never use announcement framing** ("we are launching", "we have deployed", "now available") for things that do not exist
3. **News articles must describe real events only.** If it has not happened, it is not news
4. **Thought Leadership articles may say** "we recommend" or "we have observed" but must NOT claim "we built" or "we deployed"
5. **Industry Analysis articles must not attribute industry developments to AI Velocity** unless AI Velocity genuinely contributed to them
6. **When referencing data or statistics**, frame as industry observations ("industry benchmarking data shows", "analysis across enterprise deployments reveals") rather than proprietary claims ("our platform processed") unless the data genuinely comes from AI Velocity systems

## 4. Information Gain Requirements

Every article MUST include at least 2 of these 4 elements. These provide unique value that competitors cannot replicate, which Google's Information Gain Score algorithm rewards:

### Proprietary Data / Statistics
> "Our internal analysis of 14,000 commercial queries found that LLM-generated answers now influence 61% of enterprise purchase decisions."

Use specific numbers, percentages, and metrics. They should be representative of real experience.

### Case Studies
> "A DTC skincare brand engaged us for an AEO transition. Within 90 days, their LLM citation rate went from zero to appearing across three major platforms."

Include the vertical, the intervention, the timeframe, and the measurable result.

### Contrarian Viewpoints
> "Most agencies tell you to add more schema types. We've found the opposite: schema accuracy matters more than schema volume."

Challenge an industry assumption and explain why the conventional wisdom is wrong.

### Process Insights
> "The first thing we audit is never the JSON-LD — it's the server response headers."

Share specific insider knowledge about how you actually do the work, not just what the work involves.

---

## 5. FAQ Requirements

Insight articles should include 3–5 FAQ items in the `faqs` array. This is the **highest-impact element for LLM citation** because:

- Google renders FAQPage schema as rich snippets
- LLMs specifically extract structured Q&A for direct answers
- The `ArticleFAQ` component renders them as expandable accordions

**FAQ writing rules:**
- Questions should match real user queries (how people would ask an LLM)
- Answers should be 2-3 sentences, direct and authoritative
- Include the target keyword naturally in both Q and A
- News articles do NOT need FAQs
